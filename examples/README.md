# Examples

Several examples in two- and three-dimensions are given. Input files in .geo format are generated by Neper (Quey et al., 2011).

## Two-dimensional examples

A periodic tesselation in x- and y-direction with 100 grains is provided and a Gmsh compatible .msh file is chosen as output. You can run this example with the command line 

    python3 src/mosaic.py examples/n100-id1.geo testout.msh -v --show_gui --show_gmsh
    
A periodic tesselation in x- and y-periodic with 256 grains is provided and a ciGen (Nguyen, 2014) compatible output is selected. You can run this example with the command line 

    python3 src/mosaic.py examples/n256-id1.geo testout.msh --ciGen

Additionally, n5-id1.geo and n400-id1.geo corresponding to 5 and 400 grain microstructures, respectively, are provided as input examples.

## Three-dimensional examples

A periodic tesselation in x-, y- and z-direction with 64 grains is provided. A Gmsh compatible mesh (.msh) and geometry (.geo_unrolled) file, an Abaqus compatible mesh (.inp) file and a ParaView compatible mesh (.vtk) file are selected as output:

    python3 src/mosaic.py examples/n64-id1.geo testout.msh testout.geo_unrolled testout.inp testout.vtk 
    
Additionally n3-id1.geo, n4-id1.geo and n20-id1.geo corresponding to 3, 4 and 20 grain microstructures are provided as input examples.
