# Examples

Several examples in two- and three-dimensions are given. Input files in .geo format are generated by Neper (Quey et al., 2011).

## Two-dimensional examples

A periodic tesselation in x- and y-direction with 100 grains is provided and Gmsh compatible .msh file is chosen as output. To execute Mosaic from the command line

    python3 src/mosaic.py examples/n100-id1.geo testout.msh -v --show_gui --show_gmsh
    
A periodic tesselation in x- and y-periodic with 256 grains is provided and ciGen (Nguyen, 2014) compatible output is selected. To execute Mosaic from the command line

    python3 src/mosaic.py examples/n256-id1.geo testout.msh --ciGen


## Three-dimensional examples

A periodic tesselation in x-, y- and z-direction with 64 grains is provided. Gmsh compatible mesh (.msh) and geometry (.geo_unrolled) file, Abaqus compatible mesh (.inp) file and ParaView compatible mesh (.vtk) file are selected as output formats.

    python3 src/mosaic.py examples/n64-id1.geo testout.msh testout.geo_unrolled testout.inp testout.vtk
